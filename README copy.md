# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This website showcases my projects, skills and contact information. I designed this portfolio to showcase my work and make it easy to get in touch.

## Portfolio contents

- **Projects**: A presentation of my recent projects with descriptions and links to related repositories or websites.
- **Skills**: A list of my technical skills and the technologies I master.
- **Contact**: A contact form where you can send me a message directly.

## Prerequisites

Before launching the portfolio, make sure you have installed the **Live Server** extension in your code editor. This extension allows you to launch a local server to view your site in real time.

## Launch Portfolio

To launch your portfolio, follow these steps:

1. **Open your code editor** (e.g. Visual Studio Code).
2. **Open the folder containing the `index.html`** file for your portfolio.
3. **Install the Live Server extension** if you haven't already done so:
   - Go to the Extensions tab (or use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + X`).
   - Search for **Live Server** and install it.
4. **Open the file `index.html`** in the editor.
5. **Right-click** on the `index.html` file and select **"Open with Live Server "**.

Your portfolio will then open in your default browser, and you'll be able to view it and interact with the contact form.

### Alternative without Live Server

If you don't have the Live Server extension, you can also launch the project using the following command in your terminal or command prompt: 

```
start index.html
```

### Contact

If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to send me a message via the contact form on the site.
